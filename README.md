# Python Performance with and without NumPy  
**Performance Benchmarking of Array Operations in Pure Python and NumPy**  

---

## üß† **Project Overview**

This assignment investigates the computational efficiency of **pure Python** versus **NumPy** when performing element-wise array multiplications across increasing data sizes. The goal is to highlight the importance of optimized libraries like NumPy in scientific computing.

Key concepts:
- Vector and matrix operations
- Algorithmic complexity and performance scaling
- Optimization through compiled extensions (C underpinnings of NumPy)

---

## üî¨ **Assignment Objectives**

- Implement element-wise array multiplication using **pure Python loops** and **NumPy operations**
- Compare execution times for varying array sizes (1D and 2D)
- Analyze and explain performance differences
- Present results through **graphs** and **tables**
- Reflect on the role of NumPy in Python‚Äôs numerical computing ecosystem

---

## üß™ **Experiment Design**

### Array Sizes Tested:
- **1D Arrays:** 10, 50, 100, 200, 500 elements  
- **2D Matrices:** 10√ó10, 50√ó50, 100√ó100, 200√ó200, 500√ó500  

Each configuration was tested using both implementations with average runtime calculated over 10 iterations.

### Multiplication Methods:
| Method        | Description                        |
|---------------|------------------------------------|
| Pure Python   | Iterative element-wise multiplication using lists |
| NumPy         | Vectorized operations leveraging internal optimizations |

## üìà **Results and Analysis**

### Performance Summary:
NumPy significantly outperforms pure Python, especially for large arrays. The time complexity of Python‚Äôs interpreted loops scales poorly compared to NumPy's compiled, vectorized operations.

| Tipo | Tama√±o | Tiempo_Python (s) | Tiempo_NumPy (s) |
|------|--------|-------------------|------------------|
| 1D   | 10     | 1.69e-06          | 2.29e-06         |
| 1D   | 500    | 3.63e-05          | 1.62e-06         |
| 2D   | 50√ó50  | 5.82e-04          | 2.85e-04         |
| 2D   | 500√ó500| 0.0301            | 0.0005           |

## üßµ **Code Structure**

The project is fully implemented in a single, well-organized Jupyter Notebook:
- Functions for 1D and 2D multiplication (Python and NumPy)
- Benchmarking function with repeated trials
- CSV export of results
- Data visualization using `matplotlib` and `pandas`

## üìå **Conclusion**

Through this assignment, we observed that:
- Pure Python is readable and easy to use but lacks speed at scale.
- NumPy, written in C, leverages optimized memory access and parallelism.
- Performance testing and visualization are key to understanding algorithmic trade-offs.

This experiment reinforces the importance of choosing the right tool for data-intensive computing.
